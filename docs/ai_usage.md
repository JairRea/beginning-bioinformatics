- Tool/model & version:
- What I asked for: For Rosalind problem 2: how would would I understand how to do this problem
- Snippet of prompt(s): To really understand how to solve this kind of problem, you want to break it down into what it's asking, how Python handles strings, and how slicing works. Here's a simple way to think about it:

ðŸ§  What the Problem Wants
You're given:
â€¢ 	A string 
â€¢ 	Four numbers: , , , 
You need to:
â€¢ 	Grab the part of the string from index  to  (including both)
â€¢ 	Grab another part from index  to  (also including both)
â€¢ 	Return those two parts with a space between them

- What I changed before committing:
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I provided the sample dataset and ran the code to check it.
